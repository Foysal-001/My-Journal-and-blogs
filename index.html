      <div id="story-haunted" class="story-content hidden">
        <p>Every city has its forgotten corners — places where time folds in on itself, where whispers linger in the air like cobwebs. In the heart of Old Dhaka, between two crumbling British-era buildings cloaked in ivy and rot, lies a narrow passage known to locals as Shonir Goli — The Alley of Saturn.

Nobody walks through Shonir Goli after dusk. Children are told stories of a faceless woman who waits in the shadows, of a child who laughs without eyes. Even rickshaw-pullers detour around it, murmuring prayers under their breath. It’s as if the alley breathes, repelling the living and drawing in the forgotten.

Rahim, a third-year university student and self-proclaimed urban explorer, scoffed at the idea of hauntings. He had spent his life debunking superstitions with logic and reason. To him, Shonir Goli was simply a neglected part of the city — a perfect subject for his blog.

One cloudy evening, armed with a flashlight, a digital recorder, and a phone camera, Rahim set out to document the alley. The entrance was barely noticeable — framed by decaying walls and veiled in a curtain of hanging wires and torn posters. As he stepped inside, the air changed. The bustling city sounds faded behind him, replaced by an eerie stillness. Not even the street dogs barked. Not even the crows cawed.

The alley was narrow, suffocating, and unnaturally cold. Every footstep echoed unnervingly, as though someone else walked just a beat behind. Rahim paused to check his recorder, only to realize it was already picking up faint whispers — unintelligible and layered, like voices from multiple mouths speaking in time with each other.

That’s when he noticed the walls.

They were covered in charcoal-like smudges — handprints of all sizes, as if dozens of people had tried to claw their way out. Some of them looked fresh.

His pulse quickened. Still, he pressed on, deeper into the alley, filming everything. But with every step, something gnawed at his sense of direction. The alley, which from outside appeared to be no more than 20 meters long, seemed to stretch endlessly. His flashlight flickered, and the shadows grew bolder.

Then came the scent — a sickly mix of damp earth, rusted iron, and something unmistakably rotten.

He turned sharply. A silhouette stood behind him. Not moving. Not breathing.

Rahim bolted.

He ran with everything he had. But no matter how far he sprinted, the end of the alley remained distant, retreating like a cruel mirage. The whispers grew louder — some chanting, others weeping. His vision blurred, heart thundering. Just as he felt he might collapse, a sudden gust of warm air hit him like a slap.

He had stumbled out of the alley.

He fell to his knees, gasping. Behind him, Shonir Goli stood silent — the same short stretch as before, bathed in the orange haze of a streetlamp. He looked at his watch. It was 5:23 AM.

Rahim never spoke of what happened that night. He deleted the recordings, erased the footage, and locked himself away for weeks. But those who knew him said he was never the same. He flinched at shadows, whispered in his sleep, and refused to go anywhere near Old Dhaka again.

Some say the alley chooses who to let out. And some nights, if you stand at its mouth and listen closely, you can still hear the soft click of a recorder and a trembling voice whispering:</p>
        <p>"It was never empty... it was waiting."</p>

      <div id="story-dreams" class="story-content">
        <p>Arifa had always considered herself grounded. A Computer Science student from Sylhet, her life revolved around code, logic, and patterns. But for nearly two months, her nights had been invaded by a recurring dream—vivid, unsettling, and unchanging.

In the dream, she stood at the edge of a mist-covered lake. Pines—tall and ghostly—lined its shores. A dilapidated wooden pier jutted out into the still water, and at its far end stood a man with no face. His outline was familiar, yet impossible to place. He hummed a lullaby that made her heart ache with a kind of nostalgia she couldn’t explain. Every morning she woke breathless, the melody clinging to her like fog.

She tried to dismiss it. Perhaps it was stress, or just her overworked mind playing tricks. But soon, the dream began to bleed into reality. She heard the same lullaby faintly playing in the background noise of her life—the buzz of a ceiling fan, the murmur of a crowded tea stall, the wind through trees.

It began to consume her. She stopped sleeping well. Her grades slipped. When she spoke to her friends about it, they laughed nervously and changed the subject. Her mother suggested ruqyah; her roommate insisted she change her bedsheets.

That winter, Arifa returned to her ancestral village in Sunamganj for the holidays—a quiet place wrapped in hills and mystery. On the second day there, something tugged at her, a pull in her chest. She wandered aimlessly until she found it: the lake from her dreams.

It was exactly the same. Mist curled above the water like fingers. Pines loomed where no pine trees should grow. The pier stood, creaking softly with the wind. And the moment her foot touched the wooden planks, the lullaby began again—not from the wind, but from the lake itself, echoing from beneath the surface.

She walked to the end, where the man had stood in her dreams. But no one was there. Only still water and silence.

That night, she found an old leather-bound diary in her grandfather’s trunk. The final entry was dated April 7, 1965:

“She came again last night. The girl by the lake. Same face, same voice. Always humming that cursed tune. I think the spirits haven’t forgotten... and neither have I.”

Her grandfather had disappeared that same year—vanished without a trace during a storm. The villagers never spoke of him. Some whispered he was taken. Others said he walked into the forest and never came back.

Arifa didn’t sleep that night. She didn’t dream. The lullaby had stopped. But something else replaced it.

A feeling. A knowing.

As though the lake had accepted her. Or claimed her.

She still visits the village each winter. And each time, she walks to the lake, stands at the end of the pier, and hums the lullaby—not to remember, but to remind.

Some places don’t just haunt your dreams.
Some wait for you to come home.</p>
