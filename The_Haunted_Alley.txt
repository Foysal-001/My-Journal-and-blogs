Every city has its forgotten corners — places where time folds in on itself, where whispers linger in the air like cobwebs. In the heart of Old Dhaka, between two crumbling British-era buildings cloaked in ivy and rot, lies a narrow passage known to locals as Shonir Goli — The Alley of Saturn. Nobody walks through Shonir Goli after dusk. Children are told stories of a faceless woman who waits in the shadows, of a child who laughs without eyes. Even rickshaw-pullers detour around it, murmuring prayers under their breath. It’s as if the alley breathes, repelling the living and drawing in the forgotten. Rahim, a third-year university student and self-proclaimed urban explorer, scoffed at the idea of hauntings. He had spent his life debunking superstitions with logic and reason. To him, Shonir Goli was simply a neglected part of the city — a perfect subject for his blog. One cloudy evening, armed with a flashlight, a digital recorder, and a phone camera, Rahim set out to document the alley. The entrance was barely noticeable — framed by decaying walls and veiled in a curtain of hanging wires and torn posters. As he stepped inside, the air changed. The bustling city sounds faded behind him, replaced by an eerie stillness. Not even the street dogs barked. Not even the crows cawed. The alley was narrow, suffocating, and unnaturally cold. Every footstep echoed unnervingly, as though someone else walked just a beat behind. Rahim paused to check his recorder, only to realize it was already picking up faint whispers — unintelligible and layered, like voices from multiple mouths speaking in time with each other. That’s when he noticed the walls. They were covered in charcoal-like smudges — handprints of all sizes, as if dozens of people had tried to claw their way out. Some of them looked fresh. His pulse quickened. Still, he pressed on, deeper into the alley, filming everything. But with every step, something gnawed at his sense of direction. The alley, which from outside appeared to be no more than 20 meters long, seemed to stretch endlessly. His flashlight flickered, and the shadows grew bolder. Then came the scent — a sickly mix of damp earth, rusted iron, and something unmistakably rotten. He turned sharply. A silhouette stood behind him. Not moving. Not breathing. Rahim bolted. He ran with everything he had. But no matter how far he sprinted, the end of the alley remained distant, retreating like a cruel mirage. The whispers grew louder — some chanting, others weeping. His vision blurred, heart thundering. Just as he felt he might collapse, a sudden gust of warm air hit him like a slap. He had stumbled out of the alley. He fell to his knees, gasping. Behind him, Shonir Goli stood silent — the same short stretch as before, bathed in the orange haze of a streetlamp. He looked at his watch. It was 5:23 AM. Rahim never spoke of what happened that night. He deleted the recordings, erased the footage, and locked himself away for weeks. But those who knew him said he was never the same. He flinched at shadows, whispered in his sleep, and refused to go anywhere near Old Dhaka again. Some say the alley chooses who to let out. And some nights, if you stand at its mouth and listen closely, you can still hear the soft click of a recorder and a trembling voice whispering:

"It was never empty... it was waiting."
