I never believed in ghosts—not even as a child. But something about the house on 34/B Darma Lane made my skin crawl the first time I stood before it. It wasn’t the decaying windows or the sagging roof. It was the silence. A kind that felt heavy, like it had been waiting.

The house had been empty for years. Locals said it was cursed, but no one knew why. My uncle, ever the skeptic, bought it dirt cheap at an auction. He laughed off the rumors, packed a few essentials, and moved in one foggy November morning.

He lasted four nights.

On the fifth morning, he was found sitting in the corridor, eyes wide open, whispering the same word over and over: “Below.”
He didn’t speak again. They admitted him to a clinic in Savar. Doctors said it was trauma-induced mutism. I wasn’t so sure.

Driven by guilt and curiosity, I decided to spend a night there. Just one.

I arrived just after dusk. The power was out. Candles lit the space in long, flickering shadows. The walls were covered in peeling paint, but something else too—scratches. Thin, long ones that stretched from floor to ceiling, like someone had been clawing to get out. Or in.

Around midnight, I heard it.
A creak. Then another. Then a whisper. Faint but clear.

"Let me out."

I froze. The sound was coming from beneath the floorboards in the living room. A strange rhythm began—scratch, knock, whisper. Over and over. My chest tightened with each repetition.

Summoning what little courage I had, I lifted a loose board. Beneath it was... nothing. Just soil. Dry. Cold.

Then I saw it.

A fingernail. Human. Worn down and bloodied, buried shallow in the dirt.

I backed away, heart slamming, trying not to scream. But then the whisper returned, closer, clearer—right beside my ear.

"You're late."

The candles blew out.

I don’t remember how I got out. I just remember running until my legs gave out and someone found me near the old rail tracks at dawn.

I never went back. But some nights, I still hear the scratching beneath my own floorboards. And when I do, I whisper back
