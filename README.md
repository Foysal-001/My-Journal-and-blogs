# Update 0: External Blog File Support [04.06.2025]

You no longer need to include the full blog/story content inside your HTML code.
Now, you can:
- Write each blog/story in a `.txt` file.
- Place them in the same directory (or a `/blogs/` folder).
- The blog content is dynamically loaded into the page when a user clicks on a blog title.
