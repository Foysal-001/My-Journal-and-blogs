Arifa had always considered herself grounded. A Computer Science student from Sylhet, her life revolved around code, logic, and patterns. But for nearly two months, her nights had been invaded by a recurring dream—vivid, unsettling, and unchanging. In the dream, she stood at the edge of a mist-covered lake. Pines—tall and ghostly—lined its shores. A dilapidated wooden pier jutted out into the still water, and at its far end stood a man with no face. His outline was familiar, yet impossible to place. He hummed a lullaby that made her heart ache with a kind of nostalgia she couldn’t explain. Every morning she woke breathless, the melody clinging to her like fog. She tried to dismiss it. Perhaps it was stress, or just her overworked mind playing tricks. But soon, the dream began to bleed into reality. She heard the same lullaby faintly playing in the background noise of her life—the buzz of a ceiling fan, the murmur of a crowded tea stall, the wind through trees. It began to consume her. She stopped sleeping well. Her grades slipped. When she spoke to her friends about it, they laughed nervously and changed the subject. Her mother suggested ruqyah; her roommate insisted she change her bedsheets. That winter, Arifa returned to her ancestral village in Sunamganj for the holidays—a quiet place wrapped in hills and mystery. On the second day there, something tugged at her, a pull in her chest. She wandered aimlessly until she found it: the lake from her dreams. It was exactly the same. Mist curled above the water like fingers. Pines loomed where no pine trees should grow. The pier stood, creaking softly with the wind. And the moment her foot touched the wooden planks, the lullaby began again—not from the wind, but from the lake itself, echoing from beneath the surface. She walked to the end, where the man had stood in her dreams. But no one was there. Only still water and silence. That night, she found an old leather-bound diary in her grandfather’s trunk. The final entry was dated April 7, 1965: “She came again last night. The girl by the lake. Same face, same voice. Always humming that cursed tune. I think the spirits haven’t forgotten... and neither have I.” Her grandfather had disappeared that same year—vanished without a trace during a storm. The villagers never spoke of him. Some whispered he was taken. Others said he walked into the forest and never came back. Arifa didn’t sleep that night. She didn’t dream. The lullaby had stopped. But something else replaced it. A feeling. A knowing. As though the lake had accepted her. Or claimed her. She still visits the village each winter. And each time, she walks to the lake, stands at the end of the pier, and hums the lullaby—not to remember, but to remind. Some places don’t just haunt your dreams. Some wait for you to come home.
